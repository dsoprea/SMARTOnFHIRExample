## Introduction

[SMART on FHIR](http://docs.smarthealthit.org) is an initiative to create open-standard APIs (SMART) on open-standard data-formats (FHIR).

I provide some high-level notes on SMART/FHIR usage as well as a project that hits the public sandbox and plots aggregate patient-data.

### Notes

#### Overview 

Overview of the FHIR API:

#### Resource-types

There are a number of FHIR resource-types/nouns that can be queried. For example, the following are the URLs to the SMART for FHIR sandbox for three different nouns for a particular patient:

```
$ curl -s "https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Immunization/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992" -H 'Accept: application/json'
$ curl -s "https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Encounter/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992" -H 'Accept: application/json'
$ curl -s "https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Observation/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992" -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

There doesn't appear to be a way to list the resource-types/nouns that have data for a particular patient. Rather, you just much search them all (this is reasonable).


#### Vital signs

Vital-sign measurements are recorded as "Observation" resource-types, and you can filter them by a "LOINC" code. These LOINC codes are passed as the "name" parameter, and are comma-separated. Note that the comma is itself encoded ("%2C"):

```
$ curl -s "https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Observation/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992&name=8480-6%2C8462-4%2C8302-2%2C55284-4" -H 'Accept:application/json'
```

The LOINC codes are specified at "http://docs.smarthealthit.org/profiles" under the "LOINC codes for vital signs" heading.


#### Profiles

The various different types of recorded data are referred to as "profiles". A profile is a subset of a resource-type/noun. The various other types of profiles form the majority of the content at http://docs.smarthealthit.org/profiles .


#### List of patients

You can get a list of patients in the sandbox by querying:

    https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Patient

Note that this is essentially a resource-type of "Patient" with no other parameters (as opposed to another resource-type that requires a patient as a parameter).


#### Pagination

In a given query, the "link" child may include a "self" child, and, if there is more data, a "next" child. Pagination is automatic, and these links should be used to pull additional data. Do not construct your own URLs for doing this. For more information, see "http://fhir.cerner.com/dstu1".


#### Data availability

For convenience, and as an example, patient 1288992 (Daniel Adams) has data for the following resource-types:

- AllergyIntolerance

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/AllergyIntolerance/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992

- Condition

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Condition/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992

- Encounter

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Encounter/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992

- MedicationPrescription

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/MedicationPrescription/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992

- Observation

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Observation/_search?subject%3APatient=1288992

- Patient

  https://fhir-open-api.smarthealthit.org/Patient/1288992


#### Notes

By default, the data comes down as XML unless you pass the "Accept" header.


### Test project

This [project](https://github.com/dsoprea/SMARTOnFHIRExample) is a simple exercise to read all of the available patients, bin all of their vital-sign readings (an "Observations" resource-type), and then plot a community-aggregate of any of the vital-signs that we have a sufficient volume on a histogram using [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn). There's not much data, so this is fine. All of the reads are cached, so subsequent executions are very fast.

This project is both Python 2.7- and Python 3.4-compatible.


#### Requirements

- requests
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pylab

To install the requirements, just run:

```
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Process Overview

1. Read the list of patients from the public [SMART on FIHR sandbox server](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/sandbox).
2. For each patient, read all available vitality information using the "observation" resource-type.
3. We bin the data for all vital-signs. We also filter by timestamp at this point rather than in the initial SMART query due to lack of documentation on how to use it and a lack of time to look into it.
4. We also build a catalog of the types of vital-signs and their descriptions as they are encountered.
5. In a second-pass, we render a plot for each vital-sign that we received a minimum number of records for (currently 50). This currently disqualifies everything but the diastolic and systolic blood-pressure readings. All other data is too trivial (even without a date-range filter).
6. We display the type of vital-sign in the title of the plot, as well as the unit of the measurement.


#### Features

- We will display graphs for every type of vital sign that we've received a minimum amount of data for.
- The title of the output graph will indicate the actual date-range and unit of the data found.
- The [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn) graph library is used to draw the plots, as in previous assignments. Seaborn provides very attractive representations.
- The patient data, as well as the vital sign readings, are cached locally, by default.


#### Running

```
$ python view_community_metrics.py 
```

### Sandbox Server

If you want to create your own sandbox server, very simple instruction on how to get it going using Vagrant are [here](https://github.com/jmandel/smart-on-fhir-installer) (there are also instructions on how to do it the long way). 

If you're going to use Vagrant, it's critically important that you:

1. Install all of the requirements before booting Vagrant (the instructions imply that not all are required before you start).
2. Install the exact, required version of the Ansible library that's indicated. The latest one will break the install (due to an M2Crypto thing). As the Ansible library is a Python package that's readily available on PyPI, you can easily install the right version using *pip* (package_name==x.y.z).
